=head1 NAME

getkeyset.pl - DS extraction demo

=head1 SYNOPSIS

getkeyset.pl <domain> [auth_nameserver]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The program queries for the key-set of 'domain'. Spits out the DS
records and writes the keyset to the current directory.

If the second argument is specified the query is performed to that
nameserver.


=head1 TODO

This is only a demonstration program to show how the interface can be used.
