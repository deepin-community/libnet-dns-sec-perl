Net::DNS::SEC - DNSSEC extensions to Net::DNS
=============================================

	
1. DESCRIPTION
   -----------

This module is designed as an extension the Net::DNS package
(https://metacpan.org/release/Net-DNS).

The module implements the cryptographic signature generation and
verification functions that are relevant for DNSSEC operations.

**
**		***************
**		**  WARNING  **
**		***************
**	THE USE AND/OR HANDLING OF STRONG ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES IS
**	PROHIBITED OR SEVERELY RESTRICTED IN MANY TERRITORIES.
**	PLEASE BE SURE THAT YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND THE LEGAL POSITION
**	IN YOUR COUNTRY BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO INSTALL THIS MODULE OR
**	ANY OF THE PREREQUISITE CRYPTOGRAPHY PACKAGES.
**

Net::DNS::SEC also provides a class for handling keysets.
Keysets are administrative files used by the BIND tools for key
maintenance tasks.  Net::DNS::SEC::Keyset provides an abstract
interface for doing fun things with them.

See also the 'pod' documentation in: 
	Net::DNS::RR::DNSKEY
	Net::DNS::RR::DS
	Net::DNS::RR::RRSIG
	Net::DNS::SEC::Private
and for the use of SIG0 see:
	Net::DNS::Packet (sign_sig0)
	Net::DNS::RR::SIG


2. AVAILABILITY
   ------------

You can get the latest version of Net::DNS::SEC from the
Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN):

	https://metacpan.org/release/Net-DNS-SEC

or through

	http://www.net-dns.org/

Additionally a subversion repository is made available through

	http://www.net-dns.org/svn/net-dns-sec/

The version on the "trunk" (http://www.net-dns.org/svn/net-dns-sec/trunk)
is the version that is targeted for next release.

Please note that the SVN version at any given moment may be broken.


3. PREREQUISITES
   -------------

This package relies on Net-DNS version 1.01 or later which has
features specifically designed to support Net::DNS::SEC.

The availability of prerequisites for Net::DNS::SEC is tested at
installation time.  These are the packages that need to be
available:

	File::Find
	File::Spec
	MIME::Base64
	Test::More

The cryptographic heavy lifting is performed using the OpenSSL
libcrypto library distributed under separate license.

You will also require a C compiler.


4. INSTALLATION
   ------------

Please install any modules mentioned in the PREREQUISITES section
above.  When you run "perl Makefile.PL", Perl should complain if
any of the required modules is missing.

To build this module, run the following commands:

	tar xvzf Net-DNS-SEC-1.??.tar.gz
	cd  Net-DNS-SEC-1.??
	perl Makefile.PL
	make 
	make test
	make install

'make test' will do some tests that should all succeed once all
dependencies are satisfied. Please report any failure during the
test phase.

Alternatively, install the package using CPAN:

	perl -MCPAN -e shell;
	cpan> install Net::DNS::SEC

To build the libcrypto library, run the following:

	tar xvzf openssl-3.*.tar.gz
	cd openssl-3.*
	./config shared
	make	# require only libcrypto.so* and include/openssl/*.h


5. MAINTENANCE
   -----------

Please use the CPAN request tracker to report bugs in the
extensions.  The request tracker is available through:

 https://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Net-DNS-SEC


6. STAYING UP TO DATE
   ------------------

Announcements about Net::DNS::SEC will be published on 
http://www.net-dns.org/blog/. An RSS feed is available.


7. DEMOS
   -----

demo/getkeyset.pl	A small demonstration program that will
			fetch the keyset for a specified domain,
			store the keys and print DS RRs to STDOUT.

demo/key2ds		Reads the key data from STDIN and prints
			the corresponding DS record on STDOUT.
			Contributed by Miek Gieben

demo/make-signed-keyset	Creates a self-signed keyset from a BIND
			public key specified on the command line.
			Contributed by Wes Griffin
